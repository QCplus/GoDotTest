# GoDotTest

> An opinionated test runner system to make running C# tests easier in Godot. Supports code coverage and debugging in-editor. 

For complete documentation on how to setup your project and write tests using GoDotTest, see [GoDotTestExample].

GoDotTest depends on a related addon, [GoDotNet], which provides simple dependency injection, state management, serialization, and other utilities for C# Godot development.
