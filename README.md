> An opinionated test runner system to make running C# tests easier in Godot. Supports code coverage and debugging in-editor. 

For complete documentation on how to setup your project and write tests using GoDotTest, see [GoDotTestExample]. GoDotTest is itself fully tested (it uses itself to test itself). You can see the tests for it [here][go-dot-test-tests].

GoDotTest depends on a related addon, [GoDotNet], which provides simple dependency injection, state management, serialization, and other utilities for C# Godot development.
